                Because I did not have to smell the cow’s fear,
                because I did not have to pin the man, watch his eyes
                go feral, because I did not have to drag the stones
                that formed in the child’s body, because I did not sheathe
                my hands in dank soil, or skirt the machine’s battering, the needles
                knitting my lower back, because when the factory collapsed
                I smelled no smoke, and no one made me kneel at the cop’s boots
                and count the pulse slowing beside me as every sound
                soured, because my hands have never had to resist being comforted
                by the warmth of blood, because the plastic-
                wrapped meat and the mousetraps, because my job
                was to stay clean and thankful and mostly imaginary, I have been stealing
                what little I can:
                    onions. sandpaper. handfuls of skin.
                the dumpster’s metal groan. hurried breath. hot knives.</p>
